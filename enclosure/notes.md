# Enclosure Notes

## Materials
- PLA (Polylactic Acid) filament, commonly used for 3D printing, was chosen for its ease of use, availability, and good mechanical properties for prototyping.

## Design Decisions
- The wand is split into three parts: body, stick, and head.
  - **Body:** Houses the PCB board and main electronics.
  - **Stick & Head:** Designed to be easily customizable, allowing for creative and personalized designs. This modular approach enables users to swap or modify the stick and head for different aesthetics or functionalities.

## Battery
- The enclosure is designed to fit an LP603449 3.7V 1100mAh Li-Po battery, providing a good balance between capacity and size for portable use.
